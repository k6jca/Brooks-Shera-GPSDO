# Brooks-Shera-GPSDO
Simulink Model (and other information) of the Brooks Shera (W5OJM) GPSDO

This respository contains my Simulink model of the Brooks Shera GPSDO, 
created from the comments and code in Rev 1.28 of his PIC software.

It was created using MATLAB version R2018B.

I've also included other information that might be useful to others who
might be experimenting with Shera's GPSDO algorithm.

Please note that I might have made a mistake in my equations, assumptions, 
drawings, or interpretations.  If you see anything you believe to be in 
error or if anything is confusing, please feel free to contact me at:
