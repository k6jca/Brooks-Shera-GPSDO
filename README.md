# Brooks-Shera-GPSDO
Simulink Model (and other information) of the Brooks Shera (W5OJM) GPSDO

This respository contains my Simulink model (.SLX file) of the 
Brooks Shera GPSDO, created from the comments and code in 
Rev 1.28 of his PIC software.

This simulation model was created using MATLAB version R2018B.

I have also included a PDF of a printout scan of Shera's 
PIC code (Rev. 1.28).  Please feel free to verify this source
code to my model.  (And my apologies for the PDF -- the actual 
source code file disappeared long long ago).

Please note that I might have made a mistake in my equations, assumptions, 
drawings, or interpretations.  If you see anything you believe to be in 
error or if anything is confusing, please feel free to contact me at:
